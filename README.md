## Welcome to VPC website

The goal of this club is to build a community of students, alumni and other members of Vidyalankar to boost learning and knowledge sharing.

We encourage each participant of this club to engage in different projects and activities which interests them. We also encourage alumni and senior members to provide mentorship.

The official [Github](https://github.com/vidyalankarpc) account for this group will be the central point for collaboration. Even if you are not part of Vidyalankar by any mean, you can still be a part of this club.

To get involved, contact on vidyalankarprogrammingclub@gmail.com 


PS :-  We are also looking for help to build the new webpage and a logo for this club, please contact on vidyalankarprogrammingclub@gmail.com
